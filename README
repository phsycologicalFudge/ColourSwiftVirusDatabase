ColourSwift AVDatabase

Overview

The ColourSwift AVDatabase repository contains the open virus-definition database and supporting data used by the ColourSwift AV+ Engine, the offline antivirus engine powering CS Secure Files and future ColourSwift security products.

This repository exists to distribute verified definition updates and public releases from the official ColourSwift website.

Note: Older folders such as release/ are deprecated and no longer used.



Repository Structure

clamav/
Contains ClamAV-derived signature data under GPLv2. These files are the only components covered by the GPLv2 license provided in LICENSE.

defs.vxpack
Encrypted virus-definition package used by the ColourSwift AV+ Engine. This file contains proprietary metadata, curated hash sets, ColourSwift-specific heuristics, and engine rules. It is not derived from GPL sources.

defs_key.bin
Deprecated. This key is no longer shipped. VXPack is now internally validated and authenticated by the engine.

(No more release/ APK distribution here.)
APK builds are no longer shipped through this repository. Users should obtain builds exclusively from the official ColourSwift website or store listings.



Purpose

The VXPack database forms the definition core of the ColourSwift AV+ Engine.

It enables:

• Offline detection through hash, pattern, and heuristic scanning  
• Secure verification of database integrity before load  
• Local updates distributed through the official ColourSwift update channel  

VXPack contains millions of curated malware hashes, internal ColourSwift signatures, and proprietary detection logic.  
It is encrypted and validated internally by the engine and does not reuse the old defs_key.bin pipeline.



Manual Installation

Manual APK installation no longer occurs through this repository.  
For security reasons, users must download builds directly from the official ColourSwift website or trusted store listings.



License Notice

Only the files inside the clamav/ directory are covered under the GNU General Public License v2.0 (GPL-2.0).

The LICENSE file in this repository applies solely to those GPL-derived signatures.

All other content — including VXPack, metadata, proprietary signatures, and custom ColourSwift datasets — is not derived from GPL code and is distributed under separate ColourSwift proprietary licensing.
